    <br><br>
    Formed in 1878, Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first league championship two seasons later. Following four league titles 
    and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period until a revival in the 1960s which saw the club win two league championships
    and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of success, with two League Championship successes, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. 
    The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup. The club's supporters are known as Evertonians.
